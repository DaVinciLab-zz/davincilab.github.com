    <p class ="superText2">DMRI is an in-vivo MRI technique that measures the motion of water molecules.
        The technique can be used to study the connectivity of brain regions and distribution of neuro-pathways.
        The pathways can be represented using a technique called DMRI tractography, each tract representing water
        molecules in motion along the main direction. <br />

    <h3 class="bigh3"> Anatomical Regions </h3>
    <p class ="superText2">In biomedicine, different anatomical region are named. Today, we will study five of them:<br/></p>
    <ul>
        <li>corpus callosum or CC</li>
        <li>Cingulum or CG
        <li>Corticospinal tract or CST</li>
        <li>Inferior frontaloccipital fasciculus or IFO</li>
        <li>Inferior longitudinal occipitotemporal fasciculus or ILF</li>
    </ul>
    <p class ="superText2">
        These structures are displayed below. You can rotate the model by holding down the left mouse button and dragging.
        You can also zoom in and out using the mouse wheel (or the middle button).
        Please try it now. The five part are displayed in different colors and the name of each part is labelled using the same color.

        The <font color="red">corpus callosum or CC</font> is
        the only bundle that connects the left and right brain hemispheres. In the picture,
        <font color="green">CG</font> is the green bundle sitting
        right on top of corpus callosum. It is also very thin. The <font color="blue">cortocospinal
            tract or CST </font> has a fan shape. The last two fiber bundles of
        <font color="yellow">IFO</font> and <font color="#00ffff">ILF</font>. It is easy to
        confuse these two, because they originate from the same anatomical regions.
        ILF goes all the way from anterior to posterior, while IFO turns to the lateral
        direction. Also note that this person is normal but one side of the IFO is missing
        (perhaps due to the low-resolution image sampling).
        All tasks that you will be performing will be related to these five bundles only.
