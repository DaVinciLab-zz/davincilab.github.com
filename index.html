        <br/>Training</a>
    <p class ="superText"> Here, participants will be shown a color-encoded 3D brain DMRI model that are consisted of
        5 representative fiber bundles, which are corpus callosum (CC[red color bundle], interhemispheric fibers), cingulum bundles CG[Green color bundle], (ventral-dorsal oriented),
        corticospinal tract (CST[blue color bundle], cranial-caudal oriented), ILF[Cyan] (interior longitudinal
        occipitotemporal fasciculus, anterior to posterior), and IFO[yellow](inferior frontaloccipital fasciculus, anterior to posterior to lateral)

        <br/>FA tractography Task</a>
    <p class ="superText"> In this task, participants will be shown two boxes embedded in a FA color-encoded 3D brain DMRI model.
        The FA color map is shown on the right: the redder the color, the higher the FA value. The two boxes give the participants
        hits for comparison the FA value or average FA value. Participants are asked to encode FA value information in the drawing
        for easily comparing the FA or average FA value in certain areas and they are also told the boxes are located in one of the
        five bundles (dataset information). We call this a local visualization task, because participants just need to examine only
        the tubes around the certain area (box).
        <br/>Thus, we just need to offer one fiber bundle of DMRI dataset, and we randomly generate one from the five major fiber bundles dataset.

        <br/>Tumor area Task</a>
    <p class ="superText"> In this task, participates will be shown a sphere embedded in a 3D brain DMRI model.
        The sphere just serves as a hint to tell participates the tumor position. Participates are asked to encode
        tumor position and the distance from the tumor area with the surrounding and they are also told the tumor is
        placed randomly in the dataset. We call this a local visualization task because participants only need to
        examine the tubes around the sphere (tumor).
        <br/>So we randomly generate one from the 5 major fiber bundles dataset.

        <br/>Lesion Area task</a>
    <p class ="superText"> In this task, participates will be shown a box embedded in a 3D brain DMRI model.
        There are no tubes inside the box which represents the lesion area. The box just serves as hint to
        help participates find the lesion area. Participates are asked to encode the position of the lesion area and
        they are also told the lesion are located in one of the five bundles, the box is randomly located according
        to the dataset we choose. We call this a global visualization task because participants are required to examine
        the whole fiber bundle to find the lesion area.
        <br/>So we randomly pick up one of the five major fiber bundlesâ€™ dataset.

        <br/>Tube Orientation Task</a>
    <p class ="superText"> In this task, participate will be showed three boxes embedded in a 3D brain DMRI
        model and with a set of yellow sphere marks textured in some endpoints of tubes. Participates are asked to
        convey the orientation information in the drawing. The yellow spheres show the starting point, while the three
        boxes represent the possible endpoints, those hints give the participants the goal of their encoding,
        we gives the right answer with one box has yellow spheres. We call this a global visualization task because
        it requires participants to visual scanning from the start point of a bundle to a series of endpoints, and
        it also needs to compare with the neighboring information.
        <br/>So we choose the whole brain dataset or with the combining of three or four fiber bundles.

        <br/>Same Bundle Task</a>
    <p class ="superText"> In this task, participate will be showed a 3D brain DMRI model with some fiber tracts
        marked in yellow. Participates are asked to convey the fiber bundle information in the drawing. The yellow
        fiber bundles is possible from the same bundle. About 50% of the data are in the same bundle and 50% are not.
        Their drawing could separate the five major fiber bundles, so that we could easy to judge the same bundle.
        We call this a global visualization task because it requires participants to visual scanning of the whole
        dataset to compare their similarity.
        <br/>So we choose the whole brain dataset with the five major fiber bundles.
