    <p class="superText2"> Welcome and thank you for agreeing to participate in our study.<br/>
        By taking part in this study, you will be helping us
        learn ways to visually present complicated spatial structures of our brains.  We will use the knowledge learned from your
        drawings to design new visualization
        algorithms. The results of this study
        will eventually help brain scientists examine pathological conditions
        related to disease treatment and diagnosis.

        Before we begin, please test your computer to ensure it supports the rendering. You can proceed if the left image and the right image match. <br/>
