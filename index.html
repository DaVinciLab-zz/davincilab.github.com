    <p class="superText2"> Welcome and thank you for agreeing to participate in this study.</p>
    <p>
        By taking part in this study, you will be helping us
        learn ways to visually represent complex brain spatial structures from diffusion MRI.
        The results of this study
        will eventually be used to design new algorithms to help brain
        scientists examine pathological conditions
        related to disease treatment and diagnosis.
       </p>
    <p></p>
    <p class="superText2">
    The study will include four parts
      (1) Background survey,
        (2) Training, (3) the Drawing experiment, and (4) a Post-questionnaire.
