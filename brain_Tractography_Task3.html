    <h3 class ="bigh3">Task1: FA tractography Task</h3>
    <p class ="superText2">
        In this task, you will be shown two boxes embedded in a FA color-encoded 3D brain DMRI model.
        The FA color map is shown on the right: the redder the color, the higher the FA value. You are asked to encode
        FA value information in your drawing for people to easily compare the FA (or average FA value) in certain areas.
        After finishing, your drawing should clearly show the difference of FA in different area.
        We pick up two box (marked 1, marked 2) for you, so that you can easily know which area has a higher FA value
        and help to evaluate your drawing.<br/>

    <h3 class ="bigh3">Task2: Tumor area Task</h3>
    <p class ="superText2">
        In this task, You will be shown a sphere embedded in a 3D brain DMRI model.
        The sphere represents the tumor. You are asked to encode
        tumor position and the distance from the tumor area with the surrounding tubes in your drawing.
        We give your a label (you do not need to draw the label in your drawing, but you need to draw the tumor) to show where there is a tumor area,
        and you may agree it is hard to find the "tumor" without the label . Your drawing could help us easily
        find the tumor area and the relationship between the tumor with the surrounding tubes, which is no contact, tangent or full penetration.
        Tangent means that the sphere grazed the tube(s) but did not fully intersect,
        full intersection means that the sphere intersected the tube(s).<br/>

    <h3 class ="bigh3">Task3: Lesion Area task</h3>
    <p class ="superText2">
        In this task, You will be shown a box embedded in a 3D brain DMRI model.
        There are no tubes inside the box which represents the lesion area. The box and a label just serves as hint to
        help you find the lesion area. However, you do not need to draw the box, just need to show the lesion area,
        where some part of tubes is missing in that area.
        Your drawing should encode the position of the lesion area for people easily to find the lesion area.<br/>

    <h3 class ="bigh3">Task4: Tube Orientation Task</h3>
    <p class ="superText2">
        In this task, You will be shown three boxes embedded in a 3D brain DMRI
        model and with a set of sphere marks textured in some endpoints of tubes. The  <font color="red">Red spheres</font> show the starting point
        of the tube(s), while the three
        boxes represent the possible endpoints, those hints give you the goal of your drawing,
        which is easily to show the orientation informaiton of the tubes. As for this task, people can easily find the endpoints from the three box.
        we gives the right answer for you with one box has  <font color="#00ffff">cyan spheres</font>. You should drawing the starting big Red Sphere and the 3 Box, you do not need to
        draw the Big red sphere inside the box.<br/>

    <h3 class ="bigh3">Task5: Same Bundle Task</h3>
    <p class ="superText2">
        In this task, You will be shown a 3D brain DMRI model with some fiber tracts
        marked in  <font color="yellow">yellow</font>. You are asked to convey the fiber bundle information in the drawing. The  <font color="yellow">yellow</font>
        fiber bundles is possible from the same bundle. About 50% of the data are in the same bundle and 50% are not.
        Your drawing could separate the five major fiber bundles, so that people could easy to judge whether this part
        of the fiber are from the same bundle or not? <br/>

    <h3 class ="bigh3">Task6: Depth Task</h3>
    <p class ="superText2">
        In this task, You will be shown a  <font color="blue">Blue CST </font>bundle and a  <font color="red">Red CC</font> bundle embedded in a 3D brain
        DMRI model, and You are asked to encode depth information in the drawing. When seeing the model, you may find
        it is hard to assess the distance from the viewer to the tube and the depth relationship of the tubes.
        You drawing should help in showing the depth relation of tube(s). we choose two bundle (CST and CC) for you,
        so that you can assess your drawing of depicting the depth relation of the two bundles and the individual tube in each bundle.<br/>
